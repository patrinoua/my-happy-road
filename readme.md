# My happy road
I'm currently going through one of the most peaceful phases of my life. But it hasn't always been like that.

### Accidentally depressed?

When I was 18 I felt a little blue! I used to listen to quite depressive music 
like Anathema, Opeth, Archive, Pink Floyd and all that jazz! This is some great music but it's rather on the being blue side of things!
So one day I wondered, "am I depressed and this is why I'm listening to depressive music, or do I listen to depressive
music and this makes me depressed"?

From "sad rock" (a term that I've just invented!) I turned to electroswing and electropop. 

And guess what? My mood very much improved.

Even though these bands and their songs are still in my heart I don't listen to them anymore.

What did I get out of this? 

_Some times, small changes in your environment can really affect your mood.
If you want to be happy, make sure you're not conditioning your self to be sad, by listening to "sad music", 
reading sad books or... thinking too much!_

### Circumstantially depressed
There have been other periods, where was a bigger darkness in my head and I felt [blue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68ugkg9RePc).

It often had to do with environmental factors as 
1. Economic crisis 
1. Unemployed
1. Being broke!

_Being sad is often a sign that you need to change something. So listen to what your sadness is telling you. 
Consider if you should really change something.
In my case, I changed country, developed my skills, and got a job in tech. 
As a friend once said, it's one of the least stressful professions and it pays well. 
Oh, and I made [work-in-tech.org](work-in-tech.org) if you also want to try that!_

### Just feeling blue
Even though some of the biggest problems may be solved, you still may bear blue feelings.

_On my happiness journey I realised that being happy is a skill: You need to work for it, in the same way that you need to work for anything else._

### Today
So what do I do today?

- **I sleep**. I now know the importance of sleep, I know there are morning birds and night owls AND THAT's ok (thank you dr Walker!

Luckily enough I'm not in a job where "I have to be there by 8". 
- **I wake up**. I drink a glass of water. I smile.
- **I appreciate what I have**
- **Zoom out**. When I'm feeling stressed I try to zoom out and realize these are all "first world problems", very much solvable.
- **Meditate daily**. I strongly believe in the [benefits of a daily meditation](https://www.google.com/search?q=scientific+benefits+of+meditation&oq=scientific+benefits+o&aqs=chrome.1.0i512l2j69i57j0i512l7.6377j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) practice and hope to add this in my daily routine.
- **I exercice**. Twice per week I hit the gym and get some good old endorfines!
- **I avoid toxic relationships**. If someone is giving me trouble, I try to understand where this is coming from, and perhaps try to "solve it". However, resolutions are not always possible so some times it's wise to limit communications or cut off. 
- **I keep a diary**. Not every day and not because I have to. I believe that discussing things with others is great, but discussing them with your self is even better! I keep a diary for good times, rough times, or just when I want to think deeper on a specific topic. I've been keeping a diary since I was 6 years old and it's also great to reconnect with my past selves, see the differences in believes, approach, remember details of past situations, trips and other fun stuff :) Some times I'm ranting out too, which can be therapeutic as you just "get it out of your system!". I recommend it to everyone!

Here are some of the resources that have helped me redefine some of the ways in which I look at things and build a happy path along the way:

## My Happy road

### [üìñ book] The Courage To Be Disliked - Ichiro Kishimi [link](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Ichiro-Kishimi/dp/1501197274)
How to free yourself, change your life and achieve real happiness 

Although I am not a big fan of the title this book is about [Alfred Adler's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Adler) psychology.

Adler is one of the most influencial psychologists, after Sigmunt Freud and Carl Jung.

Adler's perspective can most simply be described as ‚Äúlook forward, not backward.‚Äù 
Whereas Freud focused on how the past affects current decisions (etiological), 
Adler suggested focusing on how a current decision will affect the future (teleological)

Here is a [review](https://medium.com/@dlishego/alfred-adler-the-courage-to-be-disliked-d24b4d72a778) on the book.

### [üéô podcast] Dopamine - Andrew Huberman [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmOF0crdyRU)
After all we are also the result of our hormones. A take on dopamine, a hormone that's constantly manipulated by social media and abused by things such as gaming and porn.
Dopamine appears when we get a "win". Dr Huberman argues that we should rather learn to enjoy the journey and not the "win", otherwise after the win we just get depressed and look for the next win.

Despite living in a world where technology allows constant digital communication and opportunities to connect, it seems no one is really listening or even knows how. And it's making us lonelier, more isolated, and less tolerant than ever before. A listener by trade, New York Times contributor Kate Murphy wanted to know how we got here.

### [üìñ book] Tools of titans - Tim Ferris [link](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Timothy-Ferriss/dp/1328683788)

### [üìπ video] On relationships: Alain de Botton on Romanticism [link](https://youtu.be/sPOuIyEJnbE)
Is love spontaneous? Dr Alain argues that love is being romantisiced by pop culture and nobody talks about the hard parts.
Love, like most things, is a skill.

"A calm mind, a fit body and a house full of love: These things cannot be bought, they must be earned."
