# My happy road
I'm currently going through one of the most peaceful phases of my life. But it hasn't always been like that.

### Accidentally depressed?

When I was 18 I felt a little blue! I used to listen to quite depressive music 
like Anathema, Opeth, Archive, Pink Floyd and all that Jazz! This is some great music but it's rather on the being blue side of things!
So I wondered, "am I depressed and this is why I'm listening to depressive music, or do I listen to depressive
music and this makes me depressed"?
From "sad rock" (a term that I've just invented!) I turned to electroswing and electropop. 

And guess what? My mood very much improved.

Even though these bands and their songs are still in my heart I don't listen to them anymore.

What did I get out of this? Some times, small changes in your environment can really affect your mood.
If you want to be happy, make sure you're not conditioning your self to be sad, by listening to "sad music", 
reading sad books or... thinking too much! 

### Circumstantially depressed
There have been other periods, where was a bigger darkness in my head and I felt blue [add blue drawing here].

It often had to do with environmental factors as 
1. Economical crisis 
1. Unemployed
1. Being broke!

Being sad is often a sign that you need to act on something. So listen to what your sadness is telling you. 
Consider if you should really change something.
In my case, I changed country, developed my skills, and got a job in tech. 
As a friend once said, it's one of the least stressful professions and it pays well. 
Oh, and I made [work-in-tech.org](work-in-tech.org) if you also want to try that!

### Just a blue feeling
Even though some of the biggest problems may be solved, you still may bear blue feelings.

On my happines journey I realised:

Being happy is a skill: You need to work for it, in the same way that you need to work for anything else

Here are some of the resources that have helped me redefine and find happiness along the way:

### Today
So what do I do today?

- I sleep: I now know the importance of sleep, I know there are morning birds and night owls AND THAT's ok (thank you dr Walker!

)
so I make sure I sleep always around the same time (2AM) and wake up (with out an alarm!) around 9:30. 
Luckily (is it luck though?) enough I'm not in a job where "I have to be there by 8". 
- I wake up. I drink a glass of water. I smile.
- I exercice: Twice per week I hit the gym and get some good endorfines!
- One thing I still have not managed to do is meditate daily. I strongly believe in the [benefits of a daily meditation](https://www.google.com/search?q=scientific+benefits+of+meditation&oq=scientific+benefits+o&aqs=chrome.1.0i512l2j69i57j0i512l7.6377j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) practice and hope to add this in my daily routine.

## Happiness resources

### üìñ The Courage To Be Disliked - Ichiro Kishimi [link](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Ichiro-Kishimi/dp/1501197274)
How to free yourself, change your life and achieve real happiness 

Although I am not a big fan of the title this book is about [Alfred Adler's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Adler) psychology.

Adler is one of the biggest psychologists, after Sigmunt Freud and Carl Jung.

Adler's perspective can most simply be described as ‚Äúlook forward, not backward.‚Äù 
Whereas Freud focused on how the past affects current decisions (etiological), 
Adler suggested focusing on how a current decision will affect the future (teleological)

Here is a [review](https://medium.com/@dlishego/alfred-adler-the-courage-to-be-disliked-d24b4d72a778) on the book.

Despite living in a world where technology allows constant digital communication and opportunities to connect, it seems no one is really listening or even knows how. And it's making us lonelier, more isolated, and less tolerant than ever before. A listener by trade, New York Times contributor Kate Murphy wanted to know how we got here.
